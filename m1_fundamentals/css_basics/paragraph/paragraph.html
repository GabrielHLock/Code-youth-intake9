            <p><i>Contrary to popular belief, <b id="lorem">Lorem Ipsum</b> is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at <a href="https://www.hsc.edu/" target="_top"><b id="college">Hampden-Sydney College</b></a> in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a <b id="lorem">Lorem Ipsum</b> passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. <b id="lorem">Lorem Ipsum</b> comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of <b id="good">Good</b> and <b id="evil">Evil</b>) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of <b id="lorem">Lorem Ipsum</b>, "<b id="lorem">Lorem ipsum</b> dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</i></p>
