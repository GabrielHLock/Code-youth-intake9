    <f>Dostoevski's famous portrait</f>
    <h3><b>Here's a time line of Dosoevski's life:</b></h3>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li><b>1836–1843</b> - On 27 September 1837 Dostoevsky's mother died of tuberculosis. The previous May, his parents had sent Dostoevsky and his brother Mikhail to Saint Petersburg to attend the free Nikolayev Military Engineering Institute, forcing the brothers to abandon their academic studies for military careers. Dostoevsky entered the academy in January 1838, but only with the help of family members.</li>
        <li><b>1844–1849</b> - Dostoevsky completed his first novel, Poor Folk, in May 1845. His friend Dmitry Grigorovich, with whom he was sharing an apartment at the time, took the manuscript to the poet Nikolay Nekrasov, who in turn showed it to the renowned and influential literary critic Vissarion Belinsky. Belinsky described it as Russia's first "social novel". Poor Folk was released on 15 January 1846 in the St Petersburg Collection almanac and became a commercial success.</li>
        <li><b>1849–1854</b> - The members of the Petrashevsky Circle were denounced to Liprandi, an official at the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Dostoevsky was accused of reading works by Belinsky, including the banned Letter to Gogol,[48] and of circulating copies of these and other works.</li>
        <li><b>1854–1866</b> - After his release on 14 February 1854, Dostoevsky asked Mikhail to help him financially and to send him books by Vico, Guizot, Ranke, Hegel and Kant.[56] The House of the Dead, based on his experience in prison, was published in 1861 in the journal Vremya ("Time") – it was the first published novel about Russian prisons.</li>
        <li><b>1866–1871</b> - The first two parts of Crime and Punishment were published in January and February 1866 in the periodical The Russian Messenger,[72] attracting at least 500 new subscribers to the magazine.</li>
        <li><b>1871–1875</b> - Back in Russia in July 1871, the family was again in financial trouble and had to sell their remaining possessions. Their son Fyodor was born on 16 July, and they moved to an apartment near the Institute of Technology soon after. </li>
        <li><b>1876–1881</b> - In early 1876, Dostoevsky continued work on his Diary. The book includes numerous essays and a few short stories about society, religion, politics and ethics. </li>
