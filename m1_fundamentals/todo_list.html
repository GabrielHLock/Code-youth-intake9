       <h2 style="color: aliceblue;"><b>Steps you must follow</b></h2>
       <ol style="color: aliceblue;">
           <li> Get 3 bowls of sugar and a butter knife</li>
           <li> Dump out both packs of strawberries into a sieve or bowl and wash them thoroughly</li>
           <li> Remove the stem and leaves/crown of the strawberry. The crown can be peeled by hand, then use the butter knife to cut out the stem</li>
           <li> Large strawberries can be cut in half</li>
           <li> Once all of the strawberries are clean, put them in a standard 4 quart pot. Fill it with water to the brim</li>
           <li> Put the pot to boil. The strawberries will gradually lose their colo, which is completely normal</li>
           <li> Once it boils, let it cook for 5 mins</li>
           <li> After five minutes are over, turn off the heat and incrementally add sugar to your preference</li>
           <li> Let the pot cool, then refrigerate. Serve chilled</li>
       </ol>
